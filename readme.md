1. Why do we need javascript?<br />
Ans:- We need javascript to create an interactive and dynamic web applications, it enables client-side scripting which means
      it allows us to manipulate web-pages in real-time, to handle the event or user actions like click or submitting form and many more.
<br /><br />

2. What are variables? <br />
Ans:- Variables are the named containers which are used to store the data or information in the memory, used to access the data or information
      from the memory and also used to modify or change the data or information in the memory. We can make variables by using reserved keywords
      var, let and const. Ex:- var name = "Onkar".<br />
      Whenever we declare a variable memory gets reserved inside a memory for that variable
<br /><br />

3. What are the types of variables?<br />
Ans:- There are 3 types of variables:- <br />1. var - globally scoped and functional scoped(if declared inside function), can be re-declared and re-assigned
                                       <br />2. let - block scoped and cannot be re-declared but can be re-assigned
                                       <br />3. const - block scoped and cannot be re-declared and re-assigned
<br /><br />

4. What are the different data types in javascript?<br />
Ans:- In JS data types are divided into 2 categories:- <br />1. Primitive - Number, String, Boolean, Undefined, Null, Bigint and Symbol.<br />
                                                       2. Non-Primitive - Arrays, Objects, Function and Date.
<br /><br />

5. What is the definition of primitive and non-primitive data types?<br />
Ans:- Primitive - Primitive data types holds one value at a time, they are immutable in nature meaning we cannot perform in-place operations because whenever we alter it's value it results in creation of new value. 
      
      Non-Primitive - Non-primitive data types are the collection of primitive data types and these are mutable in nature because it allows in-place operations so we can alter it's value without creation of new result
